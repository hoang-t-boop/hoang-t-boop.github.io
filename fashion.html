                She also prefers to wear those sundresses that are perfect for literally any ocassion there is and also because they are asthetically pleasing. Moving onto shoes, she <em>loves</em> Vans which she wears on a day to day basis. On the
                other hand, she also likes strappy heels because they not only make you look taller but also look super sexy. And finally, sunglasses are the cherry on top as she says, "Sunglasses just complete the outfit." </h4>
